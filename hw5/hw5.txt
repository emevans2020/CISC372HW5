	HW5: Pthreads

Released: Thu, Apr. 30
Due: Friday, May 8, 10:00 PM

As usual, create a directory 'hw5' in your personal repository.
Commit it and all of your solution files.
Do NOT commit any generated/binary files (*.o, *.exe, a.out) 
or backup files (*~) or any other unnecessary files.

1. pin

Create a subdirectory 'pin' in your hw5 folder.
All files relating to this problem should be placed in the pin folder.

Remember the pin problem from hw3?  Create a Pthreads version of this
program.  Call it pin_pt.c.  Your program should take in the following arguments:
X: The number to calculate the pin on
NUM_THREADS: The number of threads to run your program with (must be >0)

Test it carefully by comparing against
the sequential or mpi version. Use cisc372.cis.udel.edu and SLURM to
run your program: srun -c NUM_THREADS ./pin_pt X NUM_THREADS.

Example: srun -c 40 ./pin_pt 100000000 40

What is the fastest execution time you can
achieve for input 100000000? How does it compare to the (best) MPI
version?  Answer these questions in a simple comment in the first 2
lines of the file, in the following form:

// The PIN is 2345 (Pthreads: nthreads = 40, time = 45.7 sec.) 
// The PIN is 2345 (MPI: nprocs = 40, time = 90.3 sec.)

Edit the provided Makefile so that executing 'make pin_pt' will
compile your Pthreads program and generate the executable 'pin_pt',
and executing 'make pt_medium' will run your program on the input
10000000 with 40 threads.
